&w1Players can advance through the game by gaining points. Points can be obtained by collecting valuable items (type EXAM <item> to see an items value) or by killing other players. So that it is easy to ascertain how far advanced someone is, a simple level system exists, as your points quota goes up, so does your level. The quota system is thus:

&c1         Points      Male Level     Female Level
