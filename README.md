A while back I mentioned my efforts to get a VB Based MUD up and
running. A couple of you actually showed interest (thanks
guys). Well, I've recently updated my website detailing where I am
at with it, along with a few screenshots of the server and some
in-game logs. So if you have 5 minutes, can I ask you to visit:

And let me know what you think ?

This is a one man project, so I'd apprieciate it if you wern't too
hard on me ;-)

Thanks,

Jaruzel.
