&w1The principle of this MUD is to scavenge for valuable objects and drop them in &c1The Old Throne Room&w1. In doing so, their value will be converted into points that are added to your score. The higher your score, the higher the level you will attain (type &c1LEVELS&w1). Along the way you may also be attacked by other players, or provoke a fight in which to gain or lose more points.

Help is divided up into the following sections:

   &c1MOVEMENT   &w1Information on moving your character about.
   &c1ITEMS      &w1Information on how to use items.
   &c1SOCIAL     &w1Information on communicating with people.   
   &c1MISC       &w1Information on useful commands.
   &c1COMBAT     &w1Information on Attacking other players.
   &c1BUILDING   &w1Information on Building locations
