fullname= the hollowed out head of McFly
desc= A very neat artifact. It is an actual human head that has been hollowed out, fashioned with a metal handle, and the eye sockets have been filled with 2 of the largest stones you have ever seen. The mouth is twisted into a menacing scowl and  bobs happily as you wave it in the air.
