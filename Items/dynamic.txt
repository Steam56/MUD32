When looking at a loc, scan ItemArray for items in that location (ItemArray(X,0)=Loc)
if match run off and load entry 2 from X.itm, display entry 2 to player

If player pickup object, recheck its there, if so get object weight, if weight > player carry max then deny and say too heavy msg, if we're still ok, flag itemarray(x,0)=2 and itemarray(x,1)=player num.

If player drop object, first match short and long names to see if we have object and if so, set itemarray(x,0)=1 and itemarray(x,1) to loc no. if we're in a 'special location' destroy object by itemarray(X,0)=0 and get it's value. add value to player points.

If player does inven, simply scan the itemarray and where itemarray(X,0) is 2 and ItemArray(X,1) is player num, on match list to player

Special locations are in a special.loc list in locations dir
a numeric list of locations where you can drop the item followed by a comma and then the drop descrip with %ITEM% as the instring variable.

If player quit, do a drop all. (Scan ItemArray(X,1) if match player number call DropItem)

player can give to other players - check to see if u hold item, check to see if other player is there, then just update Itemarray(X,1) to new player number.
