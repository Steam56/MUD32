0 My Ladys Bedroom
1 Although most of the Palace is in complete ruin, this bedroom (and its accompanying bathroom to the north) is still in perfect condition. In fact this bedroom looks like it has recently been used, probably not for sleeping. In the center of the room is a grand four poster bed, decked out in fine white linen, lightly scented. There are soft pillows at the head of the bed and the sheets are turned neatly down, as if inviting you climb in and enjoy yourself.
