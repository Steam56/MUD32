0 Patricians Ante-Chamber
1 Mainly used during times of crisis, this would be where the Patrician met his most trusted advisers, where they would all plot and plan around the large oak table in the middle. The Patrician, not one to miss an opportunity had the round table designed to seat 12 of his advisors and himself. The Bedroom lies to the north, the throne room to the west.
