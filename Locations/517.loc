0 The Patricians Bathroom
1 If this was once the most luxurious bathroom in all the land, then there is little evidence to show that now. Although the fixtures can still be seen jutting from the walls, the marble sinks and gold taps are nowhere to be seen, a rusty old bath stands in the corner, it's days of holding water long gone. The bedroom lies to the west.
