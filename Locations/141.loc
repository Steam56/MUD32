0 Behind the bar
1 Looking behind the bar everything is caked with piles of dust, spiders, and grime. There are many assorted bottles of scotch, whiskey, and ale that look to be aged perfectly in their respective flasks and jugs. The only way to get out from behind the bar is to jump over it again.
