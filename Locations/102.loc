0 Southern Path
1 You are traveling along a thickly wooded well travelled road. It is paved with finely crushed limestone and feels warm and inviting underfoot. The side of the road is lined with well placed smallish boulders and you can hear the calls of strange animals. The farther north you travel you notice less and less animal activity. The road continues on in a North-South Direction.
