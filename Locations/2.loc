0 The Monks Nook
1 You are standing near the centre of a smallish cave that is roughly circular in shape. The ceiling of this cave is fairly low, and there is an outcrop of rock on the far side, which looks like it could be used as a table, or a bed. There are scratch marks in the walls but they are too eroded for their meaning to be clear and a small archway leads west.
