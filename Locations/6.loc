0 The Portal
1 You find yourself standing in a small cave, that is lit in blue-white light. This light is cast from what seems to be a wall of shimmering water. If it wasn't for the constant shifting of its surface, you'd swear it was made of glass. There is a small archway which connects this cave to a similar one, albeit of larger size.
