0 Main Hall
1 Put simply this hall is massive, and in it's heyday could easily accommodate two to three hundred people. Banquets used to be a regular thing, the Old Patrician was very fond of his parties, and they attracted nobles from all the surrounding provinces.  These days alas the only thing that is in abundance is dust and some old bits of broken furniture. The throne room lies north, the entrance hall is south.
