0 Inside the Abandoned Bar
1 The bar is well lit due to the holes in the ceiling which allows light into just about everywhere. On the north side of the bar you notice a door labeled 'beer garden', and there is a smaller door to the west. Bar stools are strewn everywhere and in front of you is a large wooden bar that’s just begging you to jump over it.
