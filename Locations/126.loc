0 Inside the Cave
1 Avoiding the massive stalagtites that hang from the low ceiling, you exmaing the cave, it is lit with an eerie glow that lights the brilliant blue water that laps at the cave mouth. You can see hundreds of fish swim around the stalagmites just below the water’s surface. The cave extends north east further into the cliff.
