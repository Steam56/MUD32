0 Wooden Jetty
1 You are standing on a small wooden jetty, that juts out into the flow of the river. To the east the jetty stops and a dirt path cut into the hillside continues on.  A large sailing barge is moored here, its features indistinct as it seems to be surrunded by a localised mist. There is no visible way of boarding the vessel.
