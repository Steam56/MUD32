0 Up a Large Tree
1 You are standing on a high branch halfway up a large tree, the floor is some 20 feet below you. With careful navigation you should be able to descend. There are strong branches all around you. Through the foilage to the west you can see the top of a stone wall, some of the branches hang over it, and look strong enough to climb along.
