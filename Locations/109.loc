0 Abandoned Bar
1 The path forks off to the East, West and South. On the North side of the road stands a good size ale house that appears to be in a great state of disrepair. There are holes in the roof and several broken windows. Behind the bar you notice that the path continues to the north. There’s a nice view of water behind the bar on the horizon.
