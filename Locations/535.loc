0 A Small Cave
1 You stand in the middle of a small cave. Smooth rock walls surround you. Above you is a small hole from which ambient light drifts down. A passageway leads north but is currently blocked by a large yellow and black striped wooden sign. The words 'Under Construction' are written in white on it. From beyond the sign you can hear construction noise, some singing, and an awful lot of swearing.
