0 By The Well
1 The pungent smell of rotting moss, is at its height in here, a small room dominated by a large raised stone well in the center, also the well is the source of the constant dripping noise you can hear.  Peering into the well you can see that you can't see the bottom, this could be because of the lack of light or because the well is very deep, you'd have to go down into it to find out. A small corridor lies west.

You now realise that that was probably a very stupid thing to do, as you plummet hundreds of metres to your death.... only kidding! The well is only about 12 feet deep and you land with a medium sized splash into waist deep water.
