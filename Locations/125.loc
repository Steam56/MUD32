0 Rocky Outcrop
1 This rocky outcrop forms the southern peninsula of the island. In most places the rocks are impassable, but it is possible to reach a sandy beach to the North West and  what looks like a granite ledge to the North West. To the north there seems to be a small wooden hut, lodged precariously ontop of the rocks.
