0 Inside The Bushes
1 Although they looked impenetrable from the outside, you have fought your way into the center of the bushes, which turns out to be quite hollow, leaving enough room for probably two people, maybe three at a squeeze (if you knew each other VERY well). The ground below is dry, and there is a mellow inviting feel to the air. Shafts of golden sunlight filter in from the north.
