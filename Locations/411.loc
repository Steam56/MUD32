0 The Ramparts
1 You reach the top of the stairs and expect to be presented with an amazing view, you climbed a long way up those stairs for this so it better be good!
1 You stare out and find that you are on an island, not a very large one at that. in fact the fort, small as it is, is barely contained by its shores.
1 The island is surrounded by mist thick and dense.  A flag pole stands at the centre of the ramparts and the banner of the bear.
1 Stairs lead down.
