0 Bottom Edge of Fallow Field
1 You are on the edge of a large fallow field. Rye grass brushes your ankles and is it clear to see that this field has not been used for many years. Up the hill to the north is the rest of the field. To the east the field abruptly finishes at a cliff edge overlooking the sea. To the west and south the field is flanked by impenetrable woods.
