0 The Tunnel
1 The tunnel is low roofed and damp, in fact the deeper you go the damper it gets.
1 The walls are lined with evenly spaced torches and occasional graffiti such as 'For a good time ring 86466 and ask for Madame Baker' Kinky.
1 You can continue down the tunnel to the north or retreat south back to the barracks.
