0 Abandoned Bar - Beer Garden
1 You’re in a large beer garden that has been reclaimed by the expanding forest. Trees have sprouted through the floorboards in the large deck and most of the wood railings have been consumed by rot and have crumbled into splinters. There are metal tables and assorted chairs here that are quite comfortable and inviting to sit in. The end of the deck looks out over a rocky shore to the North and is a quite stunning view.
