0 The Boathouse
1 Upon entering the structure you notice a strange odour. In the room there is a small desk, chair and filing cabinet. Sitting in the chair hunched over the desk the husk of an old man. Since his demise, his body has become the home of many other creatures such as crabs and spiders. The old man looks like he has been dead a very long time.
