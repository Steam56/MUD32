0 The Tool Shed
1 Even the tall grass has managed to penetrate the confines of the shed, making it feel even more cramped and claustrophobic. Unlike the Guard House, the Tool Shed has managed to withstand the tests of time and remains mostly intact. One can imagine that a long time ago a gardener would have hid in here alongside his tools for a quick snack and maybe a nap. Unfortunately the gardener is long gone, and so are his tools. The only way out, is out.
