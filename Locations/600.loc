1 You are standing outside &w1The Taymark Arms&c1, a small country alehouse. Typical in its design it is a smallish flagstone building of great age, with low windows and a small wooden door at it's entrance. Above the door are the words 'The Taymark Arms - Free House' inscribed ornately on a large wooden sign. Around you are some wooden benches and tables looking quite at home on the uneven cobbles. To the northeast is a quiet lane, to the west is the pub.
