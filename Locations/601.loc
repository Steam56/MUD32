0 Taymark Arms - By The Bar
1 The public bar can get quite crowded at times, as it's not on the large side, the low beams and tobacco stained walls with old pictures of men plowing fields and women taking strolls, add quite nicely to the overall homely effect the place is having on you. You feel that you could stay here and while away the hours quite easily.  There are rooms to the north and south, and the door leads outside to the east.
