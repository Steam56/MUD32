0 Taymark Arms - The Guest Bathroom
1 This is a shared bathroom for the two guest rooms, and has all the usual things bathrooms have, a sink, a toilet, a bath, a small family of pigmies living under the U-bend, well maybe not that but it has been known to happen. Always check your U-bend, it's better to be safe than sorry. The door to the hall is east.
