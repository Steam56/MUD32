0 The Overgrown Fountain
1 Before you stands a circular stone fountain, with a high centerpiece of a statue of the Old Patrician. Looking closely at him, you can see that he was a short portly fellow with no chin and large eyes but a genial smile, so that's ok. Around his feet are ten small copper outlets, each are dribbling clear water into the bowl that is part of the fountain proper. There is waist high grass all about you in which a well-trodden path leads from the west around the fountain and off to the north.
