0 The Top
1 You reach the top of the tower breathless, and stagger into the small windowless room.
1 Before you, enclosed in a giant glass sphere is a man.  He wears dark hooded robes and an owl sits at his shoulder.
1 You reach out to touch the sphere only to pull your hand back as it begins to pass THROUGH the glass.
1 You can go down.
