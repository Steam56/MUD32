0 The Pier
1 In front of you is a large simple wooden shack built on a floating pier. It is lashed to the shore by thick ropes and seems very sturdy and well made. Lashed to the sides of the pier are a few gondolas, but none of them look serviceble. There are more pontoons lashed with ropes leading south.
1 Above you hangs a rope ladder that leads to the top of the cliff that looms far above you. Unfortuanately the ladder is out of reach (even if you jumped).
