0 Floating Platform South
1 Upon stepping onto the platform steel braces shoot out and grab your legs and you rocket off toward the other side. Looking downward you notice that there is a large river flowing at the bottom of the ravine. You feel viciously ill as you dock with the rocky cliff, the leg braces release and you are standing on a wooden platform that juts out from the rocky ledge. Your choice is either remain standing on the platform like a ninny or exit onto the dock
