0 East Intersection
1 Walking into the clearing to the east you see a reasonably large courthouse standing on a small knoll that has been overgrown by the dense forest. The millwork of the granite that it was carved from is brilliant and aside from dirt and filth looks like it did many years ago. The path travels North, South, and West.
