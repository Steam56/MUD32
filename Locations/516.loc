0 The Patricians Bedroom
1 An old wooden four poster bed stands rotting in the middle of the room, the only thing keeping it upright is probably the thick layer of dust sitting upon it. It looks very unstable and likely to collapse at any moments, follow with your eyes some footprints in the dust you can see a bathroom to the east and the ante-chamber to the south.
