0 Taymark Arms - Upper Hallway
1 You are at the beginning of a short hallway leading west, the walls are covered in that nasty fresco wallpaper that has been painted a lurid red with cream painted wood surround, the swirly 70's carpet makes you feel sick if you look at it for too long. Stairs lead down.
