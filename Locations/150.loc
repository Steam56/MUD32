0 Cliff Edge
1 You are standing at the edge of high peninsula that sticks out into the ocean, and although you can hear the waves from sea crashing into the rocks below you, you cannot see the sea through the fog that covers it.
1 A small path leads north, and a rope bridge disappears into the fog to the west.
