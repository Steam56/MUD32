0 The Sleepers
1 Before you is a large, high roofed cave cut from living rock.
1 On the floor in front of you are wooden beds.  On each bed lays a man decked in golden armour, head resting on sheild, sword clutched in hand.
1 On the far wall In great golden letters are the words 'At The Time Of Our Darkest Hour, They Will Awake'.
1 You remember a story of a wounded king carried to an enchanted isle to be healed, it was said that in time he would return when needed.
1 Arthur?
1 (B)ack takes you into the chapel.
