0 Abandoned House
1 Walking into the structure you smell a musty odor coming from the remains of some clothes and belongings that are lying mouldy on to the deteriorating floarboards. You wonder why someone would leave everything they own to just sit and rot. In one corner of the room, the floor has collapsed so badly that a hole large enough to squeeze into has been created.
