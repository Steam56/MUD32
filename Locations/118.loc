0 Pillar of the Damned
1 Around you is a large clearing, the floor is covered in small woodchippings, and there is nothing natural about this break in the woods. In the centre of the clearing is tall stone pillar, at least 40 feet in height and with a diameter of about 4 feet. You could hug it, and your hands wouldn't meet on the other side.
1 Ornately etched in to the pillar are faces; each and every one a mask of terror and torment, and at its base there are four holes bored into the stone, one at each ofthe compass points. From each of these holes oozes strange orange goo that has a distinctly sweet odour and is sticky to the touch.
