0 Top Of The Tower
1 The top of the tower is small and can only accommodate a few people at any one time. There used to be a flagpole here flying the Patricians coat of arms but was broken off by the Mythor many years ago. From up here you can see for miles. As you gaze out across the vista you see the large forest to the southeast and the great lake with it's many little islands to the northwest. To the east you can see the town of Taymark, with the river Tay running through it. Stairs lead down.
